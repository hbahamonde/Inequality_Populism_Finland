Today's democracies are grappling with the emergence of far-right parties. Our paper focuses on the ascent of populist, far-right parties in Finland and posits that escalating economic inequality sharpens the sense of loss among disadvantaged groups, fueling their support for these parties. Previous research has investigated how inequality influences radical political leanings, but our contribution highlights the principle of "loss aversion"â€”the idea that losses typically weigh heavier on people's minds than comparable gains. We integrate prospect theory, which asserts that decisions are often made in the context of perceived losses, particularly amid economic or political uncertainty. This approach offers a more precise explanation of political behavior without resorting to individual psychological analysis. Methodologically, we employ panel-data econometrics and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to dissect official data on inequality and voting patterns in Finland from 1995 to 2003. Our findings indicate that increasing inequality correlates with a 40% rise in votes for the Finns Party, Finland's primary populist far-right party.
