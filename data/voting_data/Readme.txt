Grouping of municipalities and constituencies:
Municipalities are placed in constituencies in accordance with the division
of constituencies in force in the 2019 Parliamentary elections. With regard
to earlier elections, it should be noted that the total number of
constituencies is correct but municipalities are not always under the right
constituencies. This is because municipalities may have changed
constituency.

In the printed publication of Parliamentary elections by election year, the proportion of votes gained by 
female candidates in 1987 and 1983 are presented by party and municipality (1987: Table 7 and 1983: Table 8)
